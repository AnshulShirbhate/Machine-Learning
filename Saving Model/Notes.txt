To store a model into a file so that we don't need to train a model everytime we can use various methods.

Some of these methods are:
1. pickle
2. joblib


1. Pickle: With the pickle library of python we can write the model into a binary file and store it and load it whenever we want.
Example: 
This code will create a file in the current directory storing the model
with open('file_name', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)

To load the model into the program we can write:
Example: 
with open('file_name', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)
