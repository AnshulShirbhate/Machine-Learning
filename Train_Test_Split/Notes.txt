When training a model sometimes we use the whole dataset to train the model but it is not good practice as the model can become
overfitted.

To avoid overfitting, we can split the dataset into two parts for training purposes and other part for testing purpose.

The way data is splitted is in the ration of 80:20 or 70:30. On the majority part the model is trained and on the other part 
the model is tested for accuracy.
