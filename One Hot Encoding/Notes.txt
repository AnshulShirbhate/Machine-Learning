One hot encoding is used to handle the categorical features or non numeric or text features features of the dataset.

One way to do this is to use integer encoding or label encoding. 

The way one hot encoding works is that you create new column for each of the category in the feature with categorical labels 
and assign binary value of 1 or 0.
