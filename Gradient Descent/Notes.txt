/***************MSE********************?

To find the best fit line in a scattered dataset, we need to find the line with the minimum error.

This can be done by using the cost functions in which the mean squared error is the most popular cost function.

MSE can be written as: 1/n * SUM( SQUARE( predicted point - actual point ) )

On a scattered dataset there can be multiple lines that can be drawn, but to find the best fit line we use the MSE.
The line which has the least MSE is the best fit line.

The problem with MSE is that it does a lot of iteration consuming time and increasing the computation cost.


/************Gradient Descent******************/

To solve this problem Gradient Descent comes in place. 

Gradient Descent is an algorithm that finds best fit line for given training data set.
